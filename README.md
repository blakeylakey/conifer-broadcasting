## Currently deployed version

[https://conifer-broadcasting.appspot.com/](https://conifer-broadcasting.appspot.com/)

## Description

Conifer is a free, easy to use broadcasting app. You can easily share you screen and stream it directly to anyone by sharing your stream's URL. 

Conifer uses WebRTC via simple-peer to facilitate the streams. Socket.io is used to communicate SDP information between broadcasters and receivers. Because screen sharing is not supported by all browsers, Conifer only works in Chrome and Firefox.
